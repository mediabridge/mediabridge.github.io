<b href="/hits/">HiTS</b> greatly increases the speed of web site and
application development.  Many of our products at Mediabridge are
built upon this easy to use template system.  While the template
system is HTML-like and SGML-compliant for ease of use, it also
includes a robust infrastructure which can be extended by developers.

<p align=justify>
<i>HTML Authors</i> can change the look and feel of web pages without
asking for changes from software developers, can define common
graphical features in one file without updating every single document
and are given a world of new possibilities for more dynamic documents.

<p align=justify>
<i>Web Developers</i> can define custom tags to fit the problem at
hand, can generate thousands of pages automatically, without worrying
about HTML formatting, and will have a toolchest of advanced tags to
build from.

without recompiling.  (Support for several other databases available.)
